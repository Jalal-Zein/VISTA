# VISTA
Hello!!
This is my first major project on github!
## What is VISTA?
VISTA stands for VIrtual Scheduling and Tasks Assistant.
It's supposed to be my personal scheduling assistant. This project is a Discord bot that pulls information from a Google Sheets spreadsheet to help me view & edit my schedule, keep track of todos, and remind me to follow essentials routines!
## What technologies are used?
This project was entirely built with JavaScript and node.js
## What did I learn?
This was my first time using non-vanilla JavaScript, discovering what it means practically to use a JavaScript framework!
I also learned how to interact with an API for the first time as well!
I familiarized myself with github as well!
Last but not least, I used a hosting service for the first time!

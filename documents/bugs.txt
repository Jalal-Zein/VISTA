* gax > get_all_x.js > if you call the command and mistype the day abreviation (arg) it will send the 
    previous range that was requested but with whatever retarded shit you typed
    You want it to send an error or something

 when gx doesnt understand what the day is it just sends the last task requested regardless of parameters
 if there is no defined day in the gx command it wont work because the cell b9 has the full word but it needs to be init3 to work

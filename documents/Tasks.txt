 
----------------------------- PRIORITY ------------------------------

 - look into the problems caused when having a routine or task list name be more than word, because when you want to add or edit or something, ie in cases
   where you would have more than 1 argument entered by the user the second word of the list/routine name will count for the second argument 
   // FOR NOW JUST HAVE EVERYTHING BE ONE WORD IF POSSIBLE
 - host your bot ?
 - get_now check if now and time_string can be made directly since we now have a time that is only hours
 - bug where if you delete stuff but don't reorganize, it will fuck up their index because they will appear without empty spaces but are not indexed like that
 - fix commands.txt so that it's sorted by sheet in Sched
 - explore where tts could be useful since you can do that
   by , { tts: true} inside the send() btw
 - there is still some console.logs to remove somewhere btw


----------------------------- GENERAL -------------------------------
 
 - maybe figure out a way to make tomorrow tasks auto move to priority once a day has passed
 - decide on a defenitive name for dara 
 - make an entirely new bot ?
 - upload dara to a server
 - change dara's twitter handle
 - maybe an economy tab where you can track what you bought during a month and where your income came from and stuff
 - hourly hydration reminder ?
 - maybe a batch update option where you overwrite all the tasks 
 - add tts to user feedback ? (currently tested on atl)
 - test message.reply('')
 - test expectedargs and stuff like that from  the cool stuff video in stuff.txt
 - complete crt

----------------------------- DONE ----------------------------------
 
 - test getall on a full schedule // gat.js 
 - make a "get all commands" command
 - change getall to get_today or something // gat.js
 - ask nagham to make dara a reality ? 
 - begin linking the bot to a random sheet
 - change the args in gat to match the format of =NOW()

 - test the possibility of getting a single task depending on day and time
	ie : current_task command 
	ie : get_now.js
 - check if you can get anything about a cell's color from info.data or something // ANSWER : doesnt look like it :(
 - test the conditional formatting visual reading thing (19apr21 dev jrnl para 2)	// ANSWER : IT WORKS!!! (text contains : task --> same font and cell color)
 - make init3_to_full
 - get_all_x 
 - get it rid of getall.js it serves no purpose 
 - get_x	
	ie : should work for a time today or a specific time and day
 - explore making the await line and the .data.values line into one line // ANSWER: no... i tried it and it didnt work, i reverted it and it worked. so no.

 - remove comments from help.js
 - look into the whole switch and gat situation in get_now.js
 - make the routine thing loop through the routine tasks not just paste them
 - make it so that the bot doesn't send anything if after the first time you send sleep intil the morning // IN ORDER FOR THIS TO WORK CHANGE THE TIMES YOU DON'T WANT TO BE 
   DISTURBED DURING TO "sleep2"
 - maybe make the commands command open a chrome tab with html ? // TOO MUCH WORK SO I MADE IT SEND A ATTACHMENT OF A TXT FILE. STILL BETTER THAN JUST SPAMMING
 - complete edit_routine_task.js
 - remove console logs from new commands
 - edit schedule
 - complete all the remaining routine commands
 - add all the new commands to the all commands list
